  Wardrik resolves the provider as each sign-in starts, and as each expired grant is refreshed.
  A grant is refreshed only by the provider whose `key` issued it. If the principal resolves to
  another, they sign in again with it, so no app's client ever sees another app's grant.

  The provider's `name` is the one asked for, its `key` names the OAuth app, unique to it, and
  its `client_secret` is the secret itself, or `nil`. An error stops the sign-in with it.

  Without `:resolver`, providers are resolved along the owner chain. See `WardrikOAuth.Owners`.
